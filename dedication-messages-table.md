| Hey Ally! first off, miss you. This is so incredible what you are doing. You and your family have such kind hearts. Seeing your dad at the rink, with a smile, always made my day. And your mom always gave the best hugs. Anyways, this cause is so important and bringing awareness to parkinson research will change lives! Keep doing what you are doing and can't wait to see what else you accomplish. Cheering you on from a far! | Tessa |

| I am a Sirens season ticket member, and hearing more about this initiative and seeing the lineup read from the takeover tour game has inspired me to want to support even more. I participate in many races and competitions throughout the course of the year - the key ones for me so far on the calendar for 2026 are the Jersey City Marathon, Ironman Lake Placid, Ironman Ottawa, and the NYC Marathon as well as a number of other races along the way. I had been trying to think of a way to race for more than myself, and Shake On seems like the perfect way to do it! So, in addition to matching Ally's pledge, I am also pledging $5 per mile I bike, $10 per mile I run and $20 per mile I swim for ALL of the races I do in 2026. I hope to be able to meet at some point at one of the Sirens games this season and look forward to supporting Shake On! | Matthew |
| As a loyal PWHL fan, I heard the plan that Allyson had and couldn't help but join the pledge! | Seth |
| Dedicated to: my grandpa, Harvey Knoche | Alison |
